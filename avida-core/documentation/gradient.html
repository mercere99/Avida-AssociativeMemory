<h2>Gradient Resources</h2>
<p>
Like other resources, all entries on a gradient resource line are names of individual 
resources. Gradient resources are a type of spatial resource, the main difference being
that gradient resources can move (standard gradient resources and halo gradient resources)
and can affect org movements (hills and barriers). 
</p>
<p>
Currently moving gradient resources are only supported for bounded grid environments.

<h3><A name = "GRADIENT_RESOURCE">GRADIENT_RESOURCE Command</A></h3>

<p>The syntax for the Gradient Resource command is:</p>

  <pre>GRADIENT_RESOURCE gradient_resource_name[:options]  {gradient_resource_name ...}</pre>

<p>
Habitats:<br>
The habitat a resource represents controls both the specifications of the resource (i.e. moving or stationary,
orbiting or bounded within a defined area) and any effect of the resource on the organisms (i.e. blocking or
slowing movement). Currently there are 5 habitats implemented: gradient, hills, barriers, nests, and simulated predators.
</p>
<p>
Gradient Resources: Standard and Halo  <br>
Standard gradient and halo resources allows the user to specify resource distributions which change over
time. If movement is enabled, the conical resources move around the Avida grid. This movement may 
be confined to an orbit around a specified anchor cell on the Avida grid (halos) or within a defined bounding box
(standard). 
Gradient resource cones can be capped with a plateau cylinder of a determined height wherever cone height meets or 
exceeds the value of 1. In terms of actual resource value, this is analogous to slicing the cone at height 1 and then 
setting the actual resource value (plateau) in the sliced area to some flat value. Organisms can use sense instructions 
to detect resources on all parts of the cone, but they can only consume the resources where the value is >= min value 
in the associated reaction or collect instruction. Typically, the min value is set so that only the plateau area of
the cone can be consumed. When an organism consumes any part of the cone, the cone can be set to stop moving until 
a predifined number of updates (=decay) has passed or all consumable resource (all cells with value >= 1) has been 
consumed. The cone is then refreshed at some random location within the specified boundaries. An odd but useful quirk 
is that if decay is set to 1, you can have walking wounded resources. 
</p>
<p>
Barriers: Random, Vertical, and Horizontal<br>
Barriers are far simpler than halo and standard gradient resources. Barrier resources are simply meant to represent walls
which block movement. Barriers are only implemented to be created randomly within the grid (the first block is set down
in a random cell, then the next block set in a connected random, E-W, or N-S cell, and so on). For a vertical or horizontal 
barrier, the build direction is randomly selected at the start and the build continues in that direction until all the blocks 
are placed. If the end of the world is reached and there are still blocks to place, we go back to the original cell and build
in the opposite direction. For random barriers, a random direction is selected at the start. Then, the direction of the build
continues unchanged with a 95% probability, and a new random build direction with 5% probability. The user can also 
specify and exclusion area by using halo_inner_radius and halo anchors.  <br>
Because barriers can be generated in the middle of a run, we allow orgs already standing on a barrier (which should only happen 
if they are born on a barrier or if a barrier was created underneath them) to continue moving. In other words, they can exit a 
barrier, but orgs cannot enter one. If an org (not already on a barrier) tries to enter a barrier cell, movement fails and a 0 is 
returned to the ?BX? register. Orgs can also make use of the sense-faced-habitat instruction to find the most restrictive
habitat type in the faced cell. This will return a 1 if the 'worst' resource in the faced cell is a hill, a 2 if a barrier
is in the faced cell, and a 0 if no hills or barriers are in the faced cell. 
</p>  
<p>
Hills <br>
Hills are simply meant to represent areas which slow movement. Hills are only implemented to be created randomly within the 
grid. The center block for each occurance of a hill is set down in a random cell, then the rest of the block is drawn in a 
circle around the center point using a random radius selected from within the config set radius range. The user can also 
specify and exclusion area by using halo_inner_radius and halo anchors. The effects on movement are determined by the 
resistance config setting. This is implemented as the probability of successfully moving while on a hill is equal to 1/resistance. 
As such, on average, an org on a hill with resistance = 4, will have to execute 4 move instructions to move one cell.
</p>  
Nests <br>
Nests are standard gradient resources, but by declaring a gradient resource to be a nest, the resource will 'hidden' 
from long-distance sensing instructions such as look-ahead.
</p>  
Dens <br>
Dens are unhidden nests that are visible to instructions like look-ahead.
</p>  
Predatory Resources <br>
Predatory resources are gradient resources with teeth. See SetPredatoryResource in the events list of actions.

    resources for the abs(move_speed) number of updates between moves. This

An example of setting a halo gradient of cone height 10 and radius 180.
The plateau height is 1, meaning that the actual resource height is
1 at cells where the cone height is at least 1. Movement is smooth
and is updated every 200 updates. The anchor cell is at 189, 249, and
it moves no closer than 10 cells away from the anchor and no farther than
30. The resource is immediately refreshed after it has been consumed by 
at least one organism.
